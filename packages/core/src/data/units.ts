 *   - "runt": small, cheap, or literally-named-Runt bodies — Pup, Gutter
 *     Runt, Dawn-Runt, Dusk-Runt. Gnawer joins this tribe too: fragile
 *     (1 health) glass-cannon chaff, thematically a scrappy little biter
 *     rather than a brute or plague unit. Pack-Caller itself is tagged
 *     "runt" — it's a rallying caller for the horde's little guys, and this
 *     tribe already has the deepest bench (5 other units), which makes an
 *     all-runt board a genuinely buildable theme rather than a trap with no
 *     support.
 *   - "swarm": breeding/summon-focused units — Rat-Piper (pipes in pups
 *     every wave) and Brood-Mother (births pups on faint).
 *   - "plague": poison-dealing units — Plague-Bearer and Blight-Witch.
 *   - "brute": big, tanky anchors — Warren-Warden, Dire-Rat (armored),
 *     MD Rattyfock (Warren-Warden's kit, reskinned).
 *   - Left untagged: Corpse-Glutton, Bone-Priest, Press-Kin, Ward-Weaver.
 *     None of these read as belonging to an obvious kinship group — forcing
 *     a tag on a unit with no real thematic tribe would just be noise (the
 *     issue explicitly says use judgment, not "tag everything").
